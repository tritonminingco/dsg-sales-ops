# DeepSeaGuard: Real-Time Compliance & Environmental Monitoring

*Mining data, not destruction.*

## What is DeepSeaGuard?

DeepSeaGuard (DSG) is a real-time monitoring and compliance dashboard for deep-sea mining and ocean operations. It automates environmental data collection, reporting, and compliance submission to regulators like the International Seabed Authority (ISA) and NOAA.

## The Problem:

* Companies spend weeks compiling compliance reports.
* Manual processes risk delays, penalties, or shutdowns.
* Regulators demand standardized digital, georeferenced data.

## The Solution:

DSG gives operators:

* **Real-Time Dashboards** – live monitoring of activity, alerts, and ISA zones.
* **Automated Compliance Reports** – formatted and ready for submission.
* **MapView** – overlays of nodules, AUV locations, and ISA contract zones.
* **Alerts System** – instant notifications if operations fall out of compliance.
* **Data Export** – ISA-approved formats for geology, environment, and metadata.

## Benefits:

* Save weeks of manual reporting.
* Lower risk of fines or operational shutdown.
* Build trust with regulators and investors.
* Operate with full transparency.
