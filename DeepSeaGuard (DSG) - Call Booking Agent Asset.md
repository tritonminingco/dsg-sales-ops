# DeepSeaGuard (DSG) - Call Booking Agent Asset

This document provides a comprehensive guide for booking calls with potential customers for DeepSeaGuard (DSG). It includes conversation scripts, qualification questions, objection handling, and follow-up procedures.

## 1. Conversation Scripts & Qualification Framework

**Objective:** To quickly qualify prospects and move them towards booking a call with Jorge Pimentel.

**Tone:** Human, simple, professional, and confident.

### 1.1. Opening & Introduction

**Scenario:** Cold outreach (email, LinkedIn, etc.) or inbound inquiry.

**Script:**

> "Hi [Prospect Name],
>
> My name is [Your Name], and I'm with Triton Mining Co. I'm reaching out because we've developed a tool called DeepSeaGuard that helps deep-sea mining operators automate their compliance reporting for regulators like the ISA and NOAA.
>
> I was wondering, how are you currently handling your environmental monitoring and reporting?"

### 1.2. Qualification Questions

Ask 2-3 of these questions to understand their needs and qualify them.

*   **Question 1 (Reporting):** "Are you currently reporting to the ISA or NOAA? How much time does that process typically take?"
*   **Question 2 (Environmental Monitoring):** "How are you handling environmental monitoring right now? Are you using real-time data?"
*   **Question 3 (Pain Points):** "What are some of the biggest challenges you face with compliance and reporting?"
*   **Question 4 (Current Solutions):** "What tools or systems are you currently using to manage your operational and environmental data?"

### 1.3. Transition to Value Proposition

Once you have some information, transition to the value proposition.

**Script (If they express challenges):**

> "That sounds like a lot to manage. That's exactly why we built DeepSeaGuard. It's a real-time dashboard that automates all of that. It gives you live monitoring, automated reports in the right formats for the ISA, and alerts if you're ever at risk of falling out of compliance. Our goal is to save you weeks of work and de-risk your operations."

**Script (If they seem content with their current process):**

> "That's great that you have a process in place. We're finding that many operators are looking to move to a more automated, real-time system to reduce the risk of manual errors and to have a single source of truth for regulators and investors. DeepSeaGuard provides that in a simple, easy-to-use dashboard."




## 2. Objection Handling & Value Proposition Messaging

**Objective:** To address common objections and clearly articulate the value of DSG.

### 2.1. Common Objections & Responses

*   **Objection:** "We already have a system for this."
    *   **Response:** "That's great you have a system in place. Many companies do, but they often find it's still a very manual and time-consuming process. DeepSeaGuard is different because it's fully automated and gives you a real-time view of your compliance status. This means you can catch potential issues before they become problems and save your team weeks of work. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to see how it works?"

*   **Objection:** "We're not ready for this yet."
    *   **Response:** "I understand. It sounds like this might not be a priority right now. However, we're finding that regulators are increasingly demanding more transparent and real-time data. Getting ahead of this trend can be a huge advantage. We have a short explainer PDF that I can send over, which might be useful for future planning. Would that be helpful?"

*   **Objection:** "It sounds expensive."
    *   **Response:** "I appreciate you bringing that up. We've designed DSG to be a cost-effective solution, especially when you consider the time saved and the reduced risk of fines or shutdowns. The ROI is significant. I can't give you a specific price without understanding your needs better, but a quick call with our CEO, Jorge, could clarify that for you. He can also show you a demo of the platform."

*   **Objection:** "Just send me some information."
    *   **Response:** "Of course. I can send you our 1-pager explainer and a compliance checklist. However, the best way to understand the value of DeepSeaGuard is to see it in action. It would only take 15 minutes to show you how it works and how it could specifically help [Prospect's Company]. Would you be open to that?"

### 2.2. Core Value Proposition

*   **Save Time:** "DeepSeaGuard automates the entire compliance reporting process, saving your team weeks of manual work."
*   **Reduce Risk:** "With real-time alerts and monitoring, you can avoid costly fines, penalties, or even operational shutdowns."
*   **Build Trust:** "Demonstrate your commitment to transparency and environmental responsibility to regulators, investors, and the public."
*   **Operate with Confidence:** "Know exactly where you stand with your compliance obligations at all times, with a single source of truth for your entire operation."




## 3. Follow-up Sequences & Booking Confirmation

**Objective:** To stay top-of-mind with prospects and ensure a smooth booking process.

### 3.1. Follow-up Cadence

*   **Day 1: Initial Outreach:** Send initial email or LinkedIn message.
*   **Day 3: Follow-up #1:** Send a brief follow-up message. 
    *   **Script:** "Hi [Prospect Name], just wanted to follow up on my previous message. Is automating your compliance reporting something you're interested in exploring?"
*   **Day 7: Follow-up #2 (with value):** Share a valuable resource.
    *   **Script:** "Hi [Prospect Name], I thought you might find our Deep-Sea Mining Compliance Checklist helpful. It's a great tool for assessing your current process. Let me know if you have any questions. I'd be happy to walk you through it on a quick call."
*   **Day 14: Follow-up #3 (break-up):** One final attempt.
    *   **Script:** "Hi [Prospect Name], I haven't heard back from you, so I'll assume this isn't a priority right now. If anything changes, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're always here to help you streamline your compliance and reporting."

### 3.2. Booking Confirmation
